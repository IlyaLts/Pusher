Troubleshooting
======================
If the game doesn't have sound, you need to install OpenAL (oalinst.exe).
You can find the installer in the Redist folder and run it by double-clicking on it.

If the game doesn't save screenshots and custom levels, you need to grant access to the game folder.
To do this, right-click on GrantAccess.bat, which is located in the game folder, and select ‘Run as administrator’.
